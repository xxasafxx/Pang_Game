Unity Exercise: Pang Game by Comunix


Hi Michael, my name is Assaf Sharaby.
I got an assignment from you to do a submission project.
In the project I received, I was asked to create a copy of the nostalgic game Pang-Game.
I really enjoyed creating the game from the code part, graphic design, music and sounds, and effects.
The game took it a few years back in time and I really liked it.
The bonuses I chose to do are...
Task 2 I did 3 stages of combo
The goal is to go through 3 stages before the time or life is over
And at the end of the third stage there is the end screen where the user knows he has won the game.
And there is one simple stage that is the general demo of the game and its conduct.
Also chose task 4.
The world of sounds and music has always touched me, but I did not get into it too much so I took it as a challenge myself.
I think it turned out not bad at all.
